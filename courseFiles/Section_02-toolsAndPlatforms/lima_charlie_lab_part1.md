# An Overview of LimaCharlie.

Before you get set up, here's the basics:

* *Sensors* are the primary input for data into LimaCharlie. They run on a variety of supported platforms and send JSON events to LimaCharlie's cloud in real-time. Embedded platforms (e.g. Windows, Mac, Linux) expose deeper capabilities like sending commands and collecting artifacts.
* *Organizations* are akin to “projects” - they're located in a chosen region and are where configuration and storage is located for a fleet of Sensors and their accompanying infrastructure.
* *Outputs* allow you to forward your data to storage only you control — like an SFTP server or Amazon S3. Storage within LimaCharlie is optional and allows you to store artifacts (i.e. logs) as well as search, browse, and replay historical Sensor data.
* *Add-ons* let you enable features within organizations à la carte, allowing you to run each org as lean or as sophisticated as your needs require.

The first step is to create an organization.


Fill out your fictional organization’s details.

Click **"Create Organization"**.

Wait for the organization to be created. To check, go to **"Organizations"**:
