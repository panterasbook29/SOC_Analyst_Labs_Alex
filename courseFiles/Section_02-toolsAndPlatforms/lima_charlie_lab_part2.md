# **Lima Charlie meets Atomic Red**

### **Part 2 of 2**  

>[!Tip]

> _Please complete [Part 1](./lima_charlie_lab_part1.md) of this lab first._

---

In this lab we will be creating a **controlled and fake cyber attack** with **Atomic Red**.  
We will then use **Lima Charlie** to observe what is logged and how a real-world attack may trigger alerts for investigation.

---

### **Step 1: Access Lima Charlie and Install the Atomic Red Plugin**

Continue where we left off in Part 1, logged into the **Lima Charlie** web interface.

Go to the **"Add-ons"** tab in the top right of the web page:

### **Step2: Add Detection Rules**

Now that our sensor and add-on are set up, we need to add the **detection rules** that get triggered when running tests. 

After subscribing, return to your organization and select your machine:

<img width="1816" height="590" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66e1dfab-34cc-4ca7-b221-c29332addcf5" />

Click on the **"Detections"** tab:
<img width="1827" height="782" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c13a3b5-16e3-4d99-a019-7cbcfc516e66" />


In order to select sigma rules, click on **"View extension"** in the **"ext-sigma"** tab: 
<img width="1841" height="811" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c66cf2a8-fb59-40d9-aaef-37ec72011887" />

Click **"Subscribe"**.

>[!Tip]
>
>- Sigma rules serve as the industry standard for vendor-neutral threat detection. Soteria, by contrast, is a high-fidelity managed rule set designed by security experts to offer professional-grade protection, though it typically operates as a paid service.
>
>- While these pre-packaged solutions provide excellent "out-of-the-box" coverage, you aren't locked behind a paywall; LimaCharlie’s allows you to create your own custom Detection & Response (D&R) rules manually to target specific suspicious behaviors or local threats at no extra charge.
---
**Creating your own detection rules**: 

The rules in LimaCharlie operate on a simple **"If This, Then That"** logic. The detection engine scans real-time telemetry, and when a match is found a predefined action is triggered.
<br></br>
To add a rule, go to the **Automation** tab, select **"D&R Rules"** and then click: 
<img width="1825" height="802" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8178740b-f230-4d2b-a1d5-c0179846a83d" /> 

The Rule section has a **Detect** section and a **Response** section: 
<img width="1831" height="863" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c94c6864-3bc2-4fbf-8626-3bea9dee8608" />


- RULE A : **"Suspicious Csc.exe"** detection: 
>[!Why This Rule]
>
>Attackers abuse the **csc.exe** Windows utility to convert text-based scripts into executable malware directly on the victim's machine **(this is called "Compile After Delivery")**

<br></br> 
Copy-paste the code into the **Detect** and **Response** fields.
```yaml
# Section: DETECTION
event: NEW_PROCESS
op: and
rules:
  - op: ends with
    path: event/FILE_PATH
    value: csc.exe
  - op: ends with
    path: event/PARENT/FILE_PATH
    value: powershell.exe

# Section: RESPONSE
- action: report
  name: Custom - Suspicious Csc.exe (Spawned by PowerShell)
```
- This rule monitors **"NEW_PROCESS"** type events. If the process is **csc.exe** and the parent process is **powershell.exe** then the alert triggers.
Give the rule a name and click scroll down to click **"Create"**:

- RULE B : **"Powershell Defender Disable"** detection:
>[!Why This Rule]
>
>Attackers attempt to shut down Windows Defender's real-time monitoring to "blind" the system. That way, using hacking tools and executing ransomware becomes possible without leaving traces.
<br></br>
Copy-paste the code into the **Detect** and **Response** fields.
```yaml
# Section: DETECTION
event: NEW_PROCESS
op: and
rules:
  - op: contains
    path: event/COMMAND_LINE
    value: Set-MpPreference
  - op: contains
    path: event/COMMAND_LINE
    value: DisableRealtimeMonitoring
  - op: contains
    path: event/COMMAND_LINE
    value: 'true'

# Section: RESPONSE
- action: report
  name: Custom - Powershell Defender Disable Attempt
```
Give the rule a name and click scroll down to click **"Create"**
<br></br>
The new rules should be visible:

Check the box next to the category header to select all sub-tests.


Select your host again and click **"Run Tests"**:

Immediately, a **"Request Success"** pop-up should appear, as well as a **"Job ID"**:

### **Step 4: Analyze the Logs**



![](attachments/logsscreen.png)

You'll see many events. Each time the page refreshes, new attacks may appear.

Look for **cmd.exe** or **powershell** executions.  
These are often indicators of **potential malicious activity** and warrant further investigation.
