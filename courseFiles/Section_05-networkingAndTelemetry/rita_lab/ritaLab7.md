```

1. Which external IP is contacted with the rare signature ACMS/1.0, generating nearly 35,000 connections?

 
2. One High-severity entry shows a Beacon Score of 0.23, despite a long connection duration of over 85,000 seconds. What FQDN was contacted?

 
3. Which entry shows a single connection moving over 300,000,000 bytes of data to a Microsoft domain (*.visualstudio.com)? Provide the FQDN.

 
4. An entry communicates with the same suspicious IP (168.63.129.16) but on a non-standard port (32526). What modifier is attached to this connection?
